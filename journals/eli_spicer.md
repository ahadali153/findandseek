A reflection on any design conversations that you had
At least one ah-ha! moment that you had during your coding, however small

Example:

    ## July 9, 2021

    Today, I worked on:

    * Getting a customer's data for the account page
    with Asa

    Asa and I wrote some SQL. We tested it out with
    Insomnia and the UI. We had to coordinate with
    Petra, who was working on the GHI with Azami.

    Today, I found the F2/Rename symbol functionality
    in Visual Studio Code! It allows me to rename a
    variable without causing bugs. I am going to be
    using this a lot!

## June 26th, 2023

Today, I worked on:

Finishing the wire-frame and writing the base issues.

My team and I worked on design aspects of the project regarding
choosing a database, the wire-framing, and design of the overall
project.

Today I realized how SQL works and became a lot more comfortable
with various aspects of it. I now understand the general concepts
behind the language. It really helped me to understand how we are
gonna get this project done and relieve some stress off of my
shoulders.

## June 27th, 2023

Today, I worked on:

Learning PostgreSQL, Authorization, and Figma

My team and I worked on learning various concepts
which will be vital to making our app. I learned
how to design and create our front-end portion on
figma, and my team worked on learning PostgreSQL
and beginning our database.

Today I realized how Figma works and the vitality
it has to a project. It is extremely useful in
designing and implementing a stellar looking
front-end, as well as giving you the necessary
code to easily transition it into your actual app.

## June 28th, 2023

Today, I worked on:

Figma and the PostgreSQL database.

I researched various Figma components we can
use when we begin designing our frontend. Otherwise,
my team and I worked on the PostgreSQL database and
got it organized and working.

Today I realized how useful PostgreSQL database is,
as well as how to traverse it in a better manner.
So happy to have got the database done, stress relieved.

## June 29th, 2023

Today, I worked on:

Geocoding and adventures post.

I researched how to implement the google geocoding for
our project and started making the adventures post for it.

Today I realized how to implement google's API systems into
our application and how useful it can be in the data it
provides.

## June 30th, 2023

Today, I worked on:

Geocoding, adventures, and locations.

I made the necessary files and code for the adventures and
locations, and implemented geocoding into them.

Today I realized how to divide up my files, making things
more organized and easier to flow through and read.

## June 31st, 2023

Today, I worked on:

Geocoding, adventures, and locations.

I made the necessary files and code for the adventures and
locations, and implemented geocoding into them.

Today I realized how to divide up my files, making things
more organized and easier to flow through and read.

## July 10th, 2023

Today, I worked on:

Geocoding, adventures, and locations.

I fixed files regarding the geocoding, adventures, and locations
in all aspects of queries and routers.

Today I realized how satisfying it is when you work on a feature
for hours and it works when you hit submit!!! I learned how vital
trial and error is, as well as how important it is to keep on
chugging from bug to bug!

## July 11th, 2023

Today, I worked on:

Comments and adventures.

We worked on adventures, fixing the models and adding the backend
for comments.

Today I realized how important it is to have print statements while
debugging and getting to the nitty gritty of the actual error.

## July 12th, 2023

Today, I worked on:

Finishing the backend.

We worked on comments, adventures, and activities.

Today I realized how important it is to test and check
your code before pushing to main. We found a bunch of
small bugs that would have broken our code, but we
tested it before we pushed so it was all good!

## July 13th, 2023

Today, I worked on:

Designing the front-end with Figma.

My team worked on the front-end authentication.

Today I realized how useful of a tool Figma is, and
how it can make the front-end design process seamless.

## July 14th, 2023

I was out sick, but I am all better now!

My awesome team worked on unit tests!
