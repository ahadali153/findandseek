Example:

    ## July 9, 2021

    Today, I worked on:

    * Getting a customer's data for the account page
    with Asa

    Asa and I wrote some SQL. We tested it out with
    Insomnia and the UI. We had to coordinate with
    Petra, who was working on the GHI with Azami.

    Today, I found the F2/Rename symbol functionality
    in Visual Studio Code! It allows me to rename a
    variable without causing bugs. I am going to be
    using this a lot!

## June 26th, 2023

Today, I worked on:

Finishing the wire-frame and writing the base issues.

My team and I worked on design aspects of the project regarding
choosing a database, the wire-framing, and design of the overall
project.

Today I realized how SQL works and became a lot more comfortable
with various aspects of it. I now understand the general concepts
behind the language. It really helped me to understand how we are
gonna get this project done and relieve some stress off of my
shoulders.

## June 27th, 2023

Today, I worked on:

Learning PostgreSQL, Authorization, and Figma

My team and I worked on learning various concepts
which will be vital to making our app. I learned
how to design and create our front-end portion on
figma, and my team worked on learning PostgreSQL
and beginning our database.

Today I realized how Figma works and the vitality
it has to a project. It is extremely useful in
designing and implementing a stellar looking
front-end, as well as giving you the necessary
code to easily transition it into your actual app.

## June 28th, 2023

Today, I worked on:

Figma and the PostgreSQL database.

I researched various Figma components we can
use when we begin designing our frontend. Otherwise,
my team and I worked on the PostgreSQL database and
got it organized and working.

Today I realized how useful PostgreSQL database is,
as well as how to traverse it in a better manner.
So happy to have got the database done, stress relieved.

## June 29th, 2023

Today, I worked on:

Geocoding and adventures post.

I researched how to implement the google geocoding for
our project and started making the adventures post for it.

Today I realized how to implement google's API systems into
our application and how useful it can be in the data it
provides.

## June 30th, 2023

Today, I worked on:

Geocoding, adventures, and locations.

I made the necessary files and code for the adventures and
locations, and implemented geocoding into them.

more organized and easier to flow through and read.

## July 10th, 2023

Today, I worked on:

Geocoding, adventures, and locations.

in all aspects of queries and routers.

Today I realized how satisfying it is when you work on a feature
for hours and it works when you hit submit!!! I learned how vital
trial and error is, as well as how important it is to keep on
chugging from bug to bug!

## July 11th, 2023

Today, I worked on:

Comments and adventures.

We worked on adventures, fixing the models and adding the backend
for comments.

Today I realized how important it is to have print statements while
debugging and getting to the nitty gritty of the actual error.

## July 12th, 2023

Today, I worked on:

Finishing the backend.

We worked on comments, adventures, and activities.

Today I realized how important it is to test and check
your code before pushing to main. We found a bunch of
small bugs that would have broken our code, but we
tested it before we pushed so it was all good!

## July 13th, 2023

Today, I worked on:

Designing the front-end with Figma.

My team worked on the front-end authentication.

Today I realized how useful of a tool Figma is, and
how it can make the front-end design process seamless.

I was out sick, but my awesome team worked on
getting unit tests done!

## July 17th, 2023

Today, I worked on:

Unit tests and the adventure form.

My team worked on figma, unit tests, and the adventure
form. We figured out how to finish our required unit
tests, and Jasmine & Artemis worked on figma, while Ahad
and I worked on the adventure form!

tackling problems, and how efficient it is as well!

## July 18th, 2023

Today, I worked on:

Figma while I worked on the adventure form and getting
S3 to work to store the images.

others in the Cohort and how knowledgeable everyone is!

## July 20th, 2023 - July 23rd, 2023

Today, I worked on:

S3 and Google Maps Blips.

I finished up S3 and worked on getting my blips to appear
on google maps. It took most of the day to research and
figure out how to go about doing it. My team worked on the
Nav bar and search query.

Over the weekend I worked on getting the blips to appear
and work. I got it working!

This weekend I realized how important it was to not give up,
take some time to think, and attack the problem again at a
different angle.

## July 24th, 2023

Today, I worked on:

Frontend CSS.

I worked on modals and pages for the login and sign-up forms,
as well as getting started on other little parts of CSS.

Today I realized how useful modals are for pop-up pages and
just how neat they are as well!

## July 25th, 2023

Today, I worked on:

Frontend CSS.

API and made cards for the posts.

Javascript API is, as I messed around with styling and trying
to get it to look how I wanted it to.

## July 26th, 2023

Today, I worked on:

Frontend CSS.

I worked on the detail page CSS for the adventure posts as well
as the modal form in the nav bar for creating a post.

Today I realized how cool the cards were for Bootstrap and how
well put-together and neat it makes everything look!

## July 27th, 2023

Unit tests, navbar, readme file, cleaning up code.

I worked on getting one more unit tests done, adding the functionality
for logged-in/logged-out users in the navbar, adding the readme files
as well as working on them, and cleaned up unneeded pseudo-code.

Today I realized how important patience is when handling issues and also
how much can get done when you time manage appropriately.

## July 28th, 2023

as well. From concept to development, we have done a lot and I am proud
of us!
