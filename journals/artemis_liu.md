    ## July 9, 2021

    Today, I worked on:

    * Getting a customer's data for the account page
    with Asa

    Asa and I wrote some SQL. We tested it out with
    Insomnia and the UI. We had to coordinate with
    Petra, who was working on the GHI with Azami.

    Today, I found the F2/Rename symbol functionality
    in Visual Studio Code! It allows me to rename a
    variable without causing bugs. I am going to be
    using this a lot!

## July 10th, 2023

Finished up activities and made an attempt on finding a website for our API key but realized we will need to just create the list on our own, but continued on finishing up all the methods within our function for the activities page and connecting the routes.10th

We worked on the adventures page to getting all the errors corrected and finishing up the connections between all the methods. There were a few errors that revolved around the models but got it corrected.

## July 12th, 2023

Finished activities/comments/likes/adventures files and completed the backend. We also created the separate list of outdoors activities instead of using an API to retrieve that information.
