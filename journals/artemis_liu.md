    ## July 9, 2021

    Today, I worked on:

    * Getting a customer's data for the account page
    with Asa

    Asa and I wrote some SQL. We tested it out with
    Insomnia and the UI. We had to coordinate with
    Petra, who was working on the GHI with Azami.

    Today, I found the F2/Rename symbol functionality
    in Visual Studio Code! It allows me to rename a
    variable without causing bugs. I am going to be
    using this a lot!
