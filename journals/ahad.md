In the journals, every day that you work on the project, you must make an entry in your journal after you've finished that day. At a minimum, you'll need to include the following information in each entry:

The date of the entry
A list of features/issues that you worked on and who you worked with, if applicable
A reflection on any design conversations that you had
At least one ah-ha! moment that you had during your coding, however small
Keep your journal in reverse chronological order. Always put new entries at the top.

Here's a sample of the first two entries of someone's journal file:

## July 9, 2021

Today, I worked on:

- Getting a customer's data for the account page
  with Asa

Asa and I wrote some SQL. We tested it out with
Insomnia and the UI. We had to coordinate with
Petra, who was working on the GHI with Azami.

Today, I found the F2/Rename symbol functionality
in Visual Studio Code! It allows me to rename a
variable without causing bugs. I am going to be
using this a lot!

## June 28,2023

Today I worked on:

Modifying migrations folder so each unique create/drop table pair is in a unique file, then made migrations. I also changed some table attributes to better fit the object it describes. Since my team is implementing google maps api, I researched how to fetch this data.

## June 29, 2023
