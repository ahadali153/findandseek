## June 26, 2023

Today, I worked on creating issues with my project team. Myself and my team decided on what the necessary issues were to be created for our project and assigning 2 issues per person to work on for the day.

I created user login and sign up issues.

## June 27, 2023

Today, I worked on getting PostgreSQL set up in our Docker containers. Myself and my team did some research on FastAPI and Figma today and began working on our tables in our SQL db. We brainstormed and did our research on different data types to create tables and refer back to our models.

## June 28, 2023

Today, we fixed our tables and made separate files for our migrations. We were having some issues getting everything to run properly in Docker but then we managed to get everything to work and set up our databases in pgAdmin. Tomorrow we will be ready to start fetching API for Google Maps and working on Authentication!

## June 29, 2023

Today Ahad, Artemis, and I all worked together to start getting our backend authentication set up while Eli worked on APIs for Google Maps. We made some good progress then hit a roadblock trying to get a post request to pass through FastAPI that would get a username, email, and password. We are hoping we will have authentication resolved tomorrow. It seems a lot of other groups have been stuck on the same issue.

## June 30, 2023

Today we finished up working on creating an account for a user and the login portion of the backend authentication. It was challenging, but we were able to see through with results.

## July 10, 2023

We started merging backend files and now have most of our backend complete including login/sign-up, locations, activities, and adventure files ready. We are working on getting a working API key for activities, but if that does not work we are going to manually create activities to put in the database that will be pre-registered. We just have to work on the set up for comments and likes and then the backend will be complete.

## July 11, 2023

Today we worked on fixing our models and adding comments as well as updating adventures to the backend. We hit a few roadblocks today trying to debug but we should complete the backend tomorrow.

## July 12, 2023

Today we completed the backend! We finished working on comments, activities, and adventures. We all collaborated to test out our code and worked on fixing some minor bugs. We also decided on manually creating SQL data to generate over 100 different activities that a user can input to create an adventure instead of using an API key because we couldn't find one that had exactly what we were looking for, but we are still using the Google Maps API key within our project. Tomorrow we will start on the frontend.

## July 13, 2023

Today we started to set up frontend authentication by creating user login and sign-up forms. We also took the time to explore Figma.

## July 14, 2023

Today we worked on creating unit tests. We were able to get two unit tests to pass.

## July 17, 2023

Today we created some more unit tests and managed to get them all to pass. We have 3 unit tests for activities and one for geocoding. We started working on the frontend more today and divided tasks to group members. Ahad and Eli worked on making more forms for the frontend while Artemis and I worked in Figma to start designing the web page layout. We worked on creating a logo for our application as well.

## July 18, 2023

Today Artemis and I have been working on more webpage designs through Figma while Eli and Ahad continue to work on forms for the frontend. We should be done with the design portion of it by tomorrow and then we will finish completing the rest of the frontend with the rest of the team.

## July 19, 2023

Today we finished up designs in Figma and started helping out with more frontend coding with the rest fo the team. We worked on the Adventure Detail page to get out information to register from the backend to the frontend while starting to play around with some CSS.

## July 20, 2023

We spent the day working on navigating CSS to try out different page layouts and get the hang of doing more CSS work on the Adventure Detail page. We will do some work separately over the weekend to get more functionality and proper layout of the webpage.

## July 23, 2023

Ahad and Artemis met up to work on the Nav bar layout over the weekend and I worked on getting the search bar to work and register query information. We just need to merge pages and combine the logic that Eli is writing for locations information to populate a search result.

## July 24, 2023

Today we tried to get the search results to populate within the nav bar but have been stuck on trying to get the adventure to fully populate. We made some progress with filtering results to show up in our devTools console but we still have some work to do. Hopefully tomorrow we will be able to resolve it after taking a step away from running into some bugs all day.

## July 25, 2023

Today we continued to work on filtering the search query results to populate when a user is looking for a specific adventure with additional information on price and intensity. It was challenging, but we were able to figure it out. We also merged branches with everyone else who was working on CSS for the webpage and minor tweaks to functionality.

## July 26, 2023

Today we worked on trying to get the CI/CD pipeline to work. We struggled with getting it started but we will continue tomorrow with it. I was able to start the deployment process on my computer for the group. Artemis worked on fixing the account page and Eli did some more CSS work.

## July 27, 2023

Today we continued with CI/CD deployment and made some progress but it was proven to be very challenging for us. We decided to hold off on deployment and revisiting this after we focus on other aspects of our project. Ahad and Artemis worked on fixing the account page while Eli worked on some more CSS today as well as collaborating with me on getting another unit test to run. We also worked together to get some documentation written and cleaned up any unnecessary code.
