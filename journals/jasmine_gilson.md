Today, I worked on creating issues with my project team. Myself and my team decided on what the necessary issues were to be created for our project and assigning 2 issues per person to work on for the day.

I created user login and sign up issues.

Today, I worked on getting PostgreSQL set up in our Docker containers. Myself and my team did some research on FastAPI and Figma today and began working on our tables in our SQL db. We brainstormed and did our research on different data types to create tables and refer back to our models.

Today, we fixed our tables and made separate files for our migrations. We were having some issues getting everything to run properly in Docker but then we managed to get everything to work and set up our databases in pgAdmin. Tomorrow we will be ready to start fetching API for Google Maps and working on Authentication!

Today Ahad, Artemis, and I all worked together to start getting our backend authentication set up while Eli worked on APIs for Google Maps. We made some good progress then hit a roadblock trying to get a post request to pass through FastAPI that would get a username, email, and password. We are hoping we will have authentication resolved tomorrow. It seems a lot of other groups have been stuck on the same issue.

Today we finished up working on creating an account for a user and the login portion of the backend authentication. It was challenging, but we were able to see through with results.

We started merging backend files and now have most of our backend complete including login/sign-up, locations, activities, and adventure files ready. We are working on getting a working API key for activities, but if that does not work we are going to manually create activities to put in the database that will be pre-registered. We just have to work on the set up for comments and likes and then the backend will be complete.
