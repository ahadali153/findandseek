Today, I worked on creating issues with my project team. Myself and my team decided on what the necessary issues were to be created for our project and assigning 2 issues per person to work on for the day.

I created user login and sign up issues.

Today, I worked on getting PostgreSQL set up in our Docker containers. Myself and my team did some research on FastAPI and Figma today and began working on our tables in our SQL db. We brainstormed and did our research on different data types to create tables and refer back to our models.

Today, we fixed our tables and made separate files for our migrations. We were having some issues getting everything to run properly in Docker but then we managed to get everything to work and set up our databases in pgAdmin. Tomorrow we will be ready to start fetching API for Google Maps and working on Authentication!
