## Main Page:
- Users will see a page with a nav bar at the top asking for location, activity, price, and intensity search preferences that filter out specific results in regards to what the user is looking for in an adventure. The nav bar is where the Find and Seek logo that we created will be at. On the top right hand corner, the user has an option to login, logout, sign up, and access their account page. When a user is logged in, they will have an option in the drop down menu to create an adventure.

- There will be a large map using Google Maps API key to display the different adventures a user can upload and explore through out the world. A user can click on a specific adventure find out more information, but it will initially display the adventure name, the kind of activity it is, intensity, price, description, image, and location.

- Posts that other users have made will show up using a card feature to display the same information of the adventure such as the title, description, image, intensity, price, description, activity, and location.

## View Adventure Page:
- When viewing a particular adventure, the user will be able to view the image, description, intensity rating, and price in more detail and have the option to add comments to the post.

## Account Page:
- Users who have signed up to utilize the application will be able to make a profile with Find and Seek. They will be able to upload a profile picture, their own adventures, and a biography about themselves. This page will also display all of the adventures that user has posted.

## Create an Adventure Page:
- A form where users can upload information about the adventure they want to post starting with the title description, the list of activities the user can chose from to make a post about, upload an image of the activity/location, give it a price rating from 1-5, an intensity rating from 1-5, and a description about the adventure.

## Sign Up Page:
- A form where a user can input their email, username, and password to create an account.

## Login Page:
- A form where a registered user can login in with their username and password to access their account and be able to interact with the webpage by adding comments and uploading their own adventures.
